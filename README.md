# Kubernetes YAML Files
These are some of the Kubernetes YAML files I used when migrating my setup to Kubernetes. There are several notes to do with this:
- I will accept PR's for any issues with them (I'm new to Kubernetes and want to learn) but I won't accept issues for it. This is very setup specific.
- I will not be accepting new files for the hell of it. This isn't a repository of generic Kubernetes deployments.
- I cannot say this will be updated. It depends how closed source I want to make the project I am working on at the time.
- **THIS IS SPECIFIC TO MY SETUP, IT IS MERELY HERE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, IT WILL LIKELY (OR DEFINITELY DEPENDING ON THE FILE) NOT WORK FOR YOU!**
- Some of these deployments reference services deployed with Helm.
- Oh yeah, for obvious reasons my deployed secrets aren't here.
